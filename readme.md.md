# Welcome to Best Before!

## How to use Best Before
First make sure you have all the dependecies installed, this can be checked in the source code 
or in the requirements.sh file. Then run the project by the command ```python3 run.py```. 


## What are the requirements?
Almost all requirements to run Best Before are included in the requirements.sh file. Run this file by the command ```bash requirements.sh``` in your terminal. This program was coding using python3 and as such backwards compatability is not guaranteed.

## I am unable to run this because module "xyz" is missing
If you are experiencing errors because you do not have the correct dependencies installed and requirements.sh didn't install it for you then unfortunately we cannot help you anymore then google. Most common problems are already solved in the first few google links or in discord. If in doubt, try installing the dependency using brew or apt. 

## Who made this project?
